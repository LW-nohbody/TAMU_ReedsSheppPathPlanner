# Complete System Overview - Multi-Robot Terrain Flattening

## üéØ What This Project Does

This is a **Godot 4 + C#** simulation where multiple robots use **Reeds-Shepp path planning** to cooperatively flatten a bumpy terrain disk. Each robot:
- Gets assigned a **wedge-shaped sector** of the terrain
- Continuously finds the **highest point** in its sector
- Plans a **Reeds-Shepp path** to that point
- **Digs/lowers** the area around that point
- Repeats until the terrain is completely flat

## üåà Visual Feedback System

### 1. Terrain Colors (Height Gradient)
The terrain uses vertex colors to show real-time dig progress:
- üü° **Yellow/Orange**: High terrain (needs digging)
- üü¢ **Green**: Medium height (partial progress)
- üîµ **Cyan/Blue**: Low terrain (almost flat)
- üü£ **Purple**: Flat terrain (goal achieved!)

**How it works**: After each dig, the entire terrain mesh is rebuilt with colors based on the relative heights of each vertex. As robots flatten the terrain, you'll see yellow areas turn green, then blue, then purple.

### 2. Sector Boundary Lines
Colored radial lines from the center show each robot's assigned dig zone:
- Each robot gets a unique color (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, Purple, Magenta for 8 robots)
- Lines help you verify robots stay in their sectors
- Evenly spaced around the terrain disk

### 3. Path Visualization
- Cyan line strips show each robot's planned Reeds-Shepp path
- Paths are drawn slightly above terrain
- Auto-cleanup prevents memory leaks (max 30 paths displayed)

## ü§ñ How Robots Choose Dig Points

### The Core Algorithm (SimpleDigLogic.cs)

```
1. Scan entire sector for highest point
2. If highest point is "high enough" (> flatThreshold + digThreshold):
   ‚Üí Navigate to that point and dig it
3. Else:
   ‚Üí Sector is flat, pick a random point to patrol
```

### Why This Works
- **Always targets highest point**: Naturally flattens terrain without complex planning
- **No stuck detection needed**: If a robot can't reach a point, it tries again next cycle
- **Self-organizing**: Robots automatically spread out because they target different high points
- **Coordination-free**: No communication needed between robots

### Dig Parameters
```csharp
float digRadius = 0.6f * robotWidth;  // Size of dig area
float digAmount = 0.3f;               // How much to lower per dig
float digThreshold = 0.15f;           // How "high" something must be to dig
float flatThreshold = 0.05f;          // What counts as "flat"
```

## üìÇ Key Files and Their Roles

### Core Dig System
- **`SimpleDigLogic.cs`**: Contains the "always dig highest point" algorithm
- **`VehicleBrain.cs`**: Per-robot brain that:
  - Calls SimpleDigLogic to get next dig target
  - Plans Reeds-Shepp paths using HybridReedsSheppPlanner
  - Handles movement and arrival detection
- **`WorldState.cs`**: (Minimal) Shared state for all robots

### Terrain Management
- **`TerrainDisk.cs`**: 
  - Generates noise-based terrain
  - Provides `LowerArea()` for digging
  - Computes vertex colors for visualization
  - Updates mesh and collision after each dig

### Simulation Control
- **`SimulationDirector.cs`**:
  - Spawns robots in a ring
  - Assigns each robot a sector (angle range)
  - Runs the dig cycle for all robots
  - Draws sector boundary lines
  - Manages path mesh cleanup

### Vehicle Control
- **`VehicleAgent3D.cs`**: 
  - Kinematic vehicle controller
  - Follows planned paths
  - Handles terrain alignment

### Path Planning
- **`HybridReedsSheppPlanner.cs`**: Generates Reeds-Shepp curves
- **`GridPlannerPersistent.cs`**: Obstacle avoidance grid (if obstacles exist)

---

## üîÑ System Flow

### Initialization (SimulationDirector._Ready())
1. Build obstacle grid (if obstacles exist)
2. Spawn N robots evenly spaced around terrain
3. Assign each robot a sector: `[i * (360¬∞/N), (i+1) * (360¬∞/N)]`
4. Create VehicleBrain for each robot
5. Call `brain.PlanAndGoOnce()` to start each robot
6. Draw sector visualization lines

### Per-Robot Cycle (VehicleBrain)
```
1. Robot moves along current path
2. When robot arrives at target:
   ‚Üí Call LowerArea() to dig at current position
   ‚Üí Call SimpleDigLogic.NextDigPoint() to find next target
   ‚Üí Plan Reeds-Shepp path to next target
   ‚Üí Start moving
3. Repeat until terrain is flat
```

### Dig Logic Details (SimpleDigLogic.NextDigPoint())
```csharp
// 1. Scan sector for highest point
Vector2 highestPos = FindHighestInSector(terrain, sector);
float maxHeight = GetHeightAt(highestPos);
float avgHeight = GetAverageHeight(terrain);

// 2. Decide if worth digging
if (maxHeight > avgHeight + digThreshold)
{
    // High point found - dig it!
    return (highestPos, targetAngle: angle_to_point);
}
else
{
    // Flat enough - patrol randomly
    return (RandomPointInSector(), targetAngle: random);
}
```

### Terrain Update (TerrainDisk.LowerArea())
```csharp
1. Find all grid vertices within digRadius of dig center
2. Lower each vertex by digAmount (clamped to 0 minimum)
3. Recompute vertex normals (for lighting)
4. Find min/max heights across entire terrain
5. Compute vertex color for each vertex based on height
6. Rebuild entire mesh with new heights, normals, and colors
7. Update physics collision shape
```

## üêõ Common Issues and Fixes

### Issue: Robots get stuck
**Fixed!** The new system doesn't get stuck because:
- Robots don't validate paths before executing
- If they can't reach a point, they just try again next cycle
- Always targeting the highest point ensures progress

### Issue: Godot crashes after running for a while
**Fixed!** Memory leak from excessive path meshes:
- Now limited to MAX_PATH_MESHES = 30
- Old meshes automatically cleaned up in ExitTree()
- See `CRASH_FIXED.md` for details

### Issue: Terrain stays brown, no colors
**Check**:
- `MaterialOverride` should be empty (null) on TerrainDisk
- Code creates material with `VertexColorUseAsAlbedo = true`
- See `VISUALIZATION_SYSTEM.md` for details

### Issue: No sector lines visible
**Check**:
- Console should show: `"[Director] Drew N sector boundary lines"`
- Lines are 0.05m above terrain
- Try switching to Top camera view

### Issue: Build fails
**Try**:
```bash
cd 3d
dotnet build
```
Check console for specific errors. Most recent build succeeded ‚úÖ
