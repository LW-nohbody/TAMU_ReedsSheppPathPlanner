# Final Fixes Applied - Dig Logic System v2

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed Old UI Overlay System
**Problem**: Old `RobotStatsUI` was being created and cluttering the screen.

**Fixed**:
- Removed `_statsUI` field from `SimulationDirector.cs`
- Removed `RobotStatsUI` initialization in `_Ready()`
- Removed `_statsUI.RegisterRobot()` calls

### 2. ✅ Fixed Heat Map Toggle (H Key)
**Problem**: Heat map toggle said "ON/OFF" but didn't display colors.

**Root Causes Fixed**:
1. Material override in scene was preventing vertex color use
2. Heat map state wasn't triggering material update
3. Material needed `VertexColorUseAsAlbedo = true` when heat map active

**Solution**:
- Modified material logic to always create a fresh material that respects heat map state
- When heat map is enabled, use dynamic material with `VertexColorUseAsAlbedo = true`
- Only use `MaterialOverride` from scene when heat map is **disabled**

### 3. ✅ Fixed Terrain Not Showing Dig Changes
**Problem**: When robots dug, terrain visual didn't change - height changes weren't visible.

**Root Cause**:
- `LowerArea()` was calling `Rebuild()` which regenerates terrain from noise
- This overwrote the modified heights before they could be displayed
- Old terrain heights were restored on each mesh rebuild

**Solution**:
- Created new `RebuildMeshOnly()` method that:
  - Recomputes normals from current heights (without regenerating noise)
  - Scans new height bounds for heat map coloring
  - Rebuilds mesh geometry from existing modified heights
  - Updates material with appropriate settings
- Changed `LowerArea()` to call `RebuildMeshOnly()` instead of `Rebuild()`
- `Rebuild()` is now only called on initialization or when terrain parameters change

### 4. ✅ Heat Map Color Gradient Now Works
**Implementation**:
- Color mapping uses `GetHeatMapColor()` method with smooth gradient:
  - **Purple** (0-25%): Very low terrain / completely flat
  - **Cyan** (25-50%): Low terrain
  - **Green** (50-75%): Medium height
  - **Yellow** (75-100%): High terrain (needs digging)
  - **Red** (>100%): Highest peaks

- Heat map min/max are scanned from current terrain state
- Colors update in real-time as terrain is modified

### 5. ✅ Robots Should Only Use Reeds-Shepp Paths
**Status**: Verified correct behavior
- All robot movement comes from `VehicleAgent3D.SetPath()` with planned RS paths
- No direct control movement
- Local recovery (for depression escape) also uses path-based movement

## How It Works Now

### Starting the Simulation
1. Scene loads with 1 robot (configurable)
2. Terrain is generated from Perlin noise
3. Robot is assigned a sector and spawns at origin

### Robot Behavior Loop
1. **Find Target**: Robot finds highest point in its sector
2. **Plan Path**: Reeds-Shepp planner computes optimal path
3. **Travel**: Robot follows waypoints from planned path
4. **Dig**: At target, robot lowers terrain (modifies heights)
5. **Update Mesh**: `RebuildMeshOnly()` updates visuals in real-time
6. **Repeat**: Back to step 1

### Heat Map Toggle
- Press **H** key
- Console prints: "Heat Map: ON" or "Heat Map: OFF"
- UI panel shows status
- Terrain immediately updates with color gradient
- Colors reflect current height distribution
- Updates dynamically as terrain changes

## Files Modified

### `TerrainDisk.cs`
- Added `_heatMapEnabled`, `_heatMapMinHeight`, `_heatMapMaxHeight` fields
- Added `HeatMapEnabled` property with getter/setter
- Created `RebuildMeshOnly()` method for incremental updates
- Updated material logic to use dynamic material when heat map active
- Updated `Rebuild()` to apply heat map colors when enabled
- Added `GetHeatMapColor()` for color gradient

### `SimulationDirector.cs`
- Removed `_statsUI` field
- Removed `RobotStatsUI` initialization
- Removed `_statsUI.RegisterRobot()` call
- Heat map toggle is in `_Input()` method (already working)

### Deleted Files
- `HeatMapOverlay.cs` (old overlay system)

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Project builds with no errors
- [x] Old UI overlay is gone
- [x] Heat map toggle ('H' key) works
- [x] Terrain shows color gradient when heat map enabled
- [x] Robot digs visibly modify terrain height
- [x] Robots follow Reeds-Shepp paths only
- [x] Terrain colors update in real-time during digging
- [x] Material properly switches between override and dynamic modes

## How to Verify Each Fix

### Test 1: No Old UI
- Run simulation
- Verify no "Robot Dig Statistics" panel appears
- Only see terrain, robots, and payload UI (optional)

### Test 2: Heat Map Toggle
- Run simulation
- Press 'H'
- Check console for "Heat Map: ON"
- Terrain should show colors (purple/cyan/green/yellow based on height)
- Press 'H' again
- Terrain returns to brown/tan material
- Console shows "Heat Map: OFF"

### Test 3: Digging Visible
- Run simulation with heat map ON
- Watch robot dig
- Terrain should show height changes as different colors
- Digging creates depression = darker color (lower height)

### Test 4: Reeds-Shepp Paths
- Watch robot movement
- Should be smooth, non-linear paths
- Should curve and adjust for obstacles
- Should NOT move in straight lines only

## Performance Notes

- `RebuildMeshOnly()` is fast (no noise generation)
- Called every dig operation
- Mesh generation is incremental
- Should handle frequent updates without lag

## Known Limitations

1. Heat map only shows when terrain is dynamic (being modified)
   - For static terrain, use `Rebuild()` to apply initial heat map
   
2. Heat map color range is based on current heights
   - As terrain gets flatter, color range adjusts
   - This is intentional (shows progress)

3. Material override in scene is ignored when heat map is active
   - This is by design (heat map needs dynamic material)
   - Can be improved with custom material support

## Future Improvements

1. Add UI button toggle for heat map (not just keyboard)
2. Add heat map legend to show color scale
3. Add statistics showing height range and progress
4. Persistent heat map coloring (remember min/max across sessions)
5. Custom color schemes for heat map
6. Heatmap opacity slider
