# Fixes Applied to Dig Logic System

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Removed Old HeatMapOverlay System
**Problem**: The old `HeatMapOverlay.cs` file was creating a separate overlay system that conflicted with the direct terrain heat map coloring.

**Solution**:
- Deleted `/3d/Scripts/Game/HeatMapOverlay.cs`
- Removed `HeatMapOverlay` field from `SimulationDirector.cs`
- Replaced with direct heat map toggle on `TerrainDisk` itself

### 2. Fixed Heat Map Toggle ('H' Key)
**Problem**: The 'H' key toggle reported "Heat Map: ON/OFF" in console but wasn't actually displaying the heat map colors on the terrain.

**Root Cause**: 
- Material wasn't using vertex colors
- Heat map state wasn't being passed to `Rebuild()` method properly

**Solution**:
- Updated `TerrainDisk.HeatMapEnabled` property to properly toggle heat map state
- Modified material setup to enable `VertexColorUseAsAlbedo` when heat map is active
- Heat map colors are now applied via `GetHeatMapColor()` method which uses the heat map height range
- Updated UI to display heat map status via `RobotPayloadUI.UpdateHeatMapStatus()`

### 3. Fixed Terrain Mesh Updates During Digging
**Problem**: When robots dug, terrain mesh wasn't updating with heat map colors.

**Solution**:
- Changed `LowerArea()` to call `Rebuild()` directly instead of the old `RecomputeNormalsAndMesh()`
- `Rebuild()` now properly:
  - Scans height bounds when heat map is enabled
  - Applies vertex colors via `GetHeatMapColor()` 
  - Uses material with `VertexColorUseAsAlbedo` enabled
  - Updates mesh instance and physics collider

### 4. Verified Reeds-Shepp Path-Only Movement
**Status**: Verified that robots only move using planned Reeds-Shepp paths.

**Implementation Details**:
- `VehicleAgent3D.SetPath()` receives computed RS paths
- `_PhysicsProcess()` follows waypoint-by-waypoint from the path
- Local recovery mechanism (for depression escape) also uses path-based movement
- No direct player/AI control movement - all movement is from planned paths

## How Heat Map Now Works

### Toggle Heat Map
- Press **H** key to toggle heat map on/off
- Console will print "Heat Map: ON/OFF"
- UI panel will show "Heat Map: ON" or "Heat Map: OFF"

### Color Gradient (When Enabled)
When heat map is ON, terrain is colored based on height:
- **Purple**: Very low / completely flat terrain (no work needed)
- **Cyan**: Low terrain (partially completed)
- **Green**: Medium height (in progress)
- **Yellow**: High terrain (needs digging)
- **Red**: Highest peaks (priority digging)

### Visual Updates
- Terrain colors update in real-time as robots dig
- When terrain is modified, `Rebuild()` is called which:
  1. Scans new height range
  2. Recomputes vertex colors based on new heights
  3. Updates mesh and physics

## Code Changes Summary

### Modified Files
1. **SimulationDirector.cs**
   - Removed `_heatMapOverlay` field
   - Added direct heat map toggle in `_Input()` method
   - Heat map toggle calls `_terrain.HeatMapEnabled = !_terrain.HeatMapEnabled`

2. **TerrainDisk.cs**
   - Added `_heatMapEnabled` boolean flag
   - Added `_heatMapMinHeight` and `_heatMapMaxHeight` tracking
   - Added `HeatMapEnabled` property
   - Updated `Rebuild()` to:
     - Scan height bounds when heat map enabled
     - Apply vertex colors via `GetHeatMapColor()`
     - Set material's `VertexColorUseAsAlbedo` based on heat map state
   - Updated `LowerArea()` to call `Rebuild()` directly
   - Implemented `GetHeatMapColor()` for heat map color gradient

### Deleted Files
1. **HeatMapOverlay.cs** - Removed old overlay system

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Build succeeds with no errors
- [x] Heat map toggle ('H' key) works
- [x] Terrain colors update when heat map is enabled
- [x] Robots only move in Reeds-Shepp paths
- [x] Terrain updates when robots dig
- [x] Colors reflect height changes during digging

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add heat map toggle button to UI instead of just keyboard shortcut
2. Allow adjustable heat map color schemes
3. Add heat map color legend to UI
4. Optimize heat map rendering for large terrain sizes
5. Add heat map statistics (min/max height, total area above threshold, etc.)
