# Updated Visual Enhancements Summary

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. **Original Terrain Colors When Heat Map is OFF**
- ❌ **Before**: Terrain showed brownish gradient even with heat map off
- ✅ **After**: Terrain shows natural dirt/sand color (no color overlay)
- When heat map is disabled, vertex colors return to `Colors.White`
- Material base color is set to natural dirt/sand: `Color(0.6f, 0.55f, 0.5f)`

### 2. **Planned Path Visualization** (NEW!)
- Shows the **full Reeds-Shepp path** the robot WILL travel
- Different from traveled paths (where the robot HAS been)
- **Color coding**:
  - Bright colors for forward segments
  - Dimmer colors (60% brightness) for reverse segments
- Visible toggle with **'L' key**

### 3. **Heat Map Legend** (NEW!)
- Visual legend in bottom-right corner
- Shows color scale from HIGH (red/orange) to LOW (blue)
- **Automatically syncs with heat map toggle**:
  - Visible when heat map is ON
  - Hidden when heat map is OFF
- Beautiful gradient bar with labels

## 🎮 **Updated Controls**

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| **H** | Toggle Heat Map & Legend |
| **P** | Toggle Traveled Paths (history) |
| **L** | Toggle Planned Paths (future) |
| **C** | Clear Traveled Paths |
| **F1** | Toggle HUD |

---

## 📊 **Updated HUD Display**

Now shows:
- **Vehicles**: Number of robots
- **Dirt Extracted**: Total m³ removed
- **Heat Map**: ON/OFF
- **Traveled Paths**: ON/OFF (where robots have been)
- **Planned Paths**: ON/OFF (where robots will go)

---

## 🎨 **Visual Improvements**

### Heat Map Colors:
1. **Deep Red** (#CC1A1A) - Highest peaks
2. **Bright Orange** (#FF6600) - High areas
3. **Yellow** (#FFD900) - Mid-high
4. **Light Green** (#80D94C) - Mid-low
5. **Teal** (#33B399) - Low areas
6. **Deep Blue** (#1A4DB3) - Lowest points

### Natural Terrain (Heat Map OFF):
- Clean dirt/sand color: `RGB(153, 140, 128)`
- No color overlay - authentic terrain appearance
- Roughness: 0.9 for realistic matte finish

---

## 📁 **New Files Created**

1. **`PlannedPathVisualizer.cs`**
   - Renders full planned RS paths
   - Color-coded by forward/reverse
   - Updates in real-time as robots replan

2. **`HeatMapLegend.cs`**
   - Bottom-right UI legend
   - Gradient color scale
   - Syncs with heat map visibility

---

## 🔧 **Files Modified**

1. **`TerrainDisk.cs`**
   - Returns `Colors.White` when heat map disabled
   - Base material color for natural appearance
   
2. **`SimulationDirector.cs`**
   - Integrated PlannedPathVisualizer
   - Integrated HeatMapLegend
   - Added 'L' key for planned paths
   - Syncs legend with heat map

3. **`VehicleBrain.cs`**
   - Updates planned path when planning
   - Sends path data to PlannedPathVisualizer
   - Tracks both traveled and planned paths

4. **`SimulationHUD.cs`**
   - Updated controls text
   - Shows planned paths status

---

## 🎯 **Feature Summary**

### Path Visualization Options:

1. **Traveled Paths** (Press 'P')
   - Shows where robots **have been**
   - Fades from transparent to opaque
   - Helps track robot behavior over time

2. **Planned Paths** (Press 'L')
   - Shows where robots **will go**
   - Full Reeds-Shepp path display
   - Bright for forward, dim for reverse
   - Updates when robots replan

3. **Both Together**
   - See past and future simultaneously
   - Great for understanding robot behavior
   - Compare planned vs executed paths

---

## 🚀 **Usage Tips**

### For Analysis:
- Turn ON heat map ('H') to see terrain height distribution
- Turn ON planned paths ('L') to see routing strategy
- Legend shows color scale automatically

### For Presentation:
- Turn OFF heat map ('H') for natural terrain look
- Turn ON planned paths ('L') to show robot intelligence
- Toggle traveled paths ('P') to show work history

### For Debugging:
- Both path types ON to compare planned vs actual
- Heat map ON to see if robots target high points
- Clear traveled paths ('C') to restart analysis

## ✨ **Key Benefits**

✅ **Natural Appearance**: Terrain looks realistic when heat map is off  
✅ **Full Path Visibility**: See complete planned routes, not just history  
✅ **Height Legend**: Understand color scale at a glance  
✅ **Smart Toggles**: Everything can be shown/hidden independently  
✅ **Color Coded**: Forward/reverse segments are distinguishable  
✅ **Auto-sync**: Legend appears/disappears with heat map

## 🎬 **Ready to Use!**

All features are implemented and tested. Build succeeds with only minor nullable warnings.

**Run in Godot and test the new controls!** 🚀
