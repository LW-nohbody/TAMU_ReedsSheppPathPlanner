# Build Fix Summary

## Problem
After merging the `main` branch into the `rooney-dig-fix` feature branch, the project failed to build with numerous syntax errors in `TerrainDisk.cs`.

## Root Cause
The `TerrainDisk.cs` file was severely corrupted during the merge, with duplicate code blocks, merge conflict markers, and broken syntax throughout the file.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Restored Clean TerrainDisk.cs from Main Branch
```bash
git show main:3d/Scripts/Game/TerrainDisk.cs > /tmp/TerrainDisk_main.cs
cp /tmp/TerrainDisk_main.cs 3d/Scripts/Game/TerrainDisk.cs
```

The main branch version was clean but lacked methods that the new dig system requires.

### 2. Added Missing Methods to TerrainDisk.cs

Added three essential methods that the new dig system needs:

#### `LowerArea(Vector3 worldXZ, float radius, float deltaHeight)`
- Lowers terrain height within a circular area
- Updates the height grid (`_heights` array)
- Calls `RecomputeNormalsAndMesh()` to rebuild visual mesh and collision

#### `GetMaxLocalHeight()`
- Scans the entire height grid to find the maximum terrain height
- Used by the dig system to track flattening progress
- Returns 0 if no valid heights exist

#### `RecomputeNormalsAndMesh()`
- Recalculates surface normals using central difference
- Rebuilds the visual mesh using `SurfaceTool`
- Updates the collision shape with the new mesh
- Called after terrain modification to keep visuals and physics in sync

### 3. Fixed UpdateLabel Call in SimulationDirector.cs

The `SimulationDirector` was trying to call `terrain.UpdateLabel()` which doesn't exist in the base TerrainDisk class.

**Solution:** Commented out the UpdateLabel call and replaced it with a `GD.Print()` for console logging:
```csharp
// TODO: Re-implement UpdateLabel if needed for visualization
// _terrain.UpdateLabel(...);
GD.Print($"[Stats] Max Height: {maxHeight:F2}m");
```

## Build Status
âœ… **Project now builds successfully!**

```bash
cd /Users/aliz/Documents/GitHub/TAMU_ReedsSheppPathPlanner/3d
dotnet build Reeds-Shepp_3D_Test.csproj
# Build succeeded in 0.6s
```

## Files Modified

1. **3d/Scripts/Game/TerrainDisk.cs**
   - Replaced with clean version from main
   - Added `LowerArea()` method (27 lines)
   - Added `GetMaxLocalHeight()` method (8 lines)
   - Added `RecomputeNormalsAndMesh()` method (145 lines)

2. **3d/Scripts/SimCore/Godot/SimulationDirector.cs**
   - Commented out `terrain.UpdateLabel()` call
   - Added console logging as temporary replacement

## Next Steps

1. **Test in Godot**: Open the project in Godot and run the simulation to verify:
   - Robots spawn correctly
   - Robots dig in their assigned sectors
   - Terrain flattens over time
   - No runtime errors

2. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Re-implement UpdateLabel as a Label3D attached to terrain for live stats
   - Add more detailed console logging for dig operations
   - Implement visualization for robot sectors

3. **Git Commit**: Once tested, commit the build fixes:
   ```bash
   git add 3d/Scripts/Game/TerrainDisk.cs
   git add 3d/Scripts/SimCore/Godot/SimulationDirector.cs
   git commit -m "fix: restore TerrainDisk after merge and add dig methods"
   ```

## Technical Notes

- The main branch TerrainDisk is a static terrain generator (creates terrain once at startup)
- The feature branch needs dynamic terrain modification (dig operations at runtime)
- The added methods bridge this gap by allowing runtime height modification with automatic mesh/collision updates
- The `RecomputeNormalsAndMesh()` method is expensive (rebuilds entire mesh), so dig operations should be batched when possible

## Merge Conflict Prevention

For future merges:
1. Always review merge conflicts in files carefully
2. Use `git diff` to compare feature branch changes before merging
3. Consider using a 3-way merge tool (e.g., KDiff3, Meld) for complex conflicts
4. Test build immediately after resolving conflicts
5. Keep feature branches up-to-date with main via regular merges/rebases
