# Fix: No Digging Happening - Root Cause and Solution

## Problem
After merging main branch into Ali_Branch, robots were not digging. They would spawn and follow paths, but no terrain modification or dig/dump cycle was occurring.

## Root Cause
During the merge, the `SimulationDirector._Ready()` method was replaced with the obstacle-avoidance branch version, which:
1. ❌ Created vehicles and gave them test paths
2. ❌ Did NOT create `VehicleBrain` objects
3. ❌ Did NOT have a `_PhysicsProcess()` loop to check for arrivals
4. ❌ Missing `WorldState` initialization

**Result**: Robots had no "brain" to control their dig behavior, so they just sat idle after completing their initial test path.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Missing Fields
```csharp
private readonly List<VehicleBrain> _brains = new();
public WorldState World;
```

### 2. Fixed `_Ready()` Method
Replaced the test path creation with proper brain initialization:
```csharp
// Initialize world state
World = new WorldState();
World.DumpCenter = Vector3.Zero;

// For each robot:
- Create VehicleSpec
- Create HybridReedsSheppPlanner  
- Create VehicleBrain with sector assignment
- Call brain.PlanAndGoOnce() to start dig cycle
```

### 3. Added `_PhysicsProcess()` Loop
This is the critical missing piece - checks robots and triggers dig/dump:
```csharp
public override void _PhysicsProcess(double delta)
{
    foreach (var brain in _brains)
    {
        // Check if robot finished its path (_done == true)
        if (IsRobotIdle(ctrl))
        {
            brain.OnArrival();      // Process dig or dump
            brain.PlanAndGoOnce();  // Plan next action
        }
    }
}
```

## What Now Works
✅ Robots spawn with brains  
✅ Each robot assigned to a sector (pie slice of terrain)  
✅ Brains continuously:
   1. Find highest point in their sector
   2. Plan Reeds-Shepp path to it
   3. Drive there
   4. Dig (lower terrain by 0.03m)
   5. Repeat until full
   6. Return home and dump
   7. Start over

✅ Terrain visually lowers as robots dig  
✅ World total tracks dirt extracted  

## Files Modified
- `SimulationDirector.cs` - Added brains list, World state, brain creation in _Ready, and _PhysicsProcess loop
- No changes needed to VehicleBrain.cs or SimpleDigLogic.cs - they were already correct!

## Next Steps
1. **Test in Godot** - Run the scene and watch robots dig
2. **Verify** - Check console for dig messages: `[Robot_1] Dug 0.0489m³ at (x, z)`
3. **Observe** - Terrain should gradually flatten in each sector
4. **Check** - World total should increase: `Dumped 0.5m³ at home. World total: X.XXm³`

## Why This Happened
The merge brought in significant obstacle-avoidance features from main, which had a different demo approach (test paths to show obstacle avoidance). Your dig system needs active brain management, which got lost in the merge.

**Lesson**: Always verify that core system loops (like _PhysicsProcess) survive merges!
