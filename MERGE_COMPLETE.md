# Merge Complete - Ready to Push! âœ…

## Summary
Successfully merged `origin/main` into `Ali_Branch` with your simple dig system changes.

## Build Status
âœ… **Compiled successfully** - 0 errors, 0 warnings

## What Was Merged From Main
- Obstacle avoidance system (new files)
- Camera orbit controls  
- Cylinder obstacles
- Various bug fixes and improvements

## What You Added
- `SimpleDigLogic.cs` - Smart peak-flattening algorithm
- Complete `VehicleBrain.cs` rewrite - Clean state machine
- Dig radius now relative to robot width
- Improved local recovery in `VehicleAgent3D.cs`
- Documentation files (this one, SIMPLE_DIG_SYSTEM.md, etc.)

## Conflicts Resolved
1. âœ… `WorldState.cs` - Kept both obstacle list and your dig logic
2. âœ… `VehicleAgent3D.cs` - Merged local recovery with main's changes
3. âœ… `SimulationDirector.cs` - Kept your simplified version
4. âœ… `SimulationDirector.tscn` - Merged scene changes
5. âœ… Fixed `ProblemLogger` reference (removed obsolete call)

4. Title: **"Simple Dig System with Reeds-Shepp Path Planning"**

### Suggested PR Description:
```markdown
## Overview
Complete rewrite of the dig system with a smart, simple approach that prevents robots from getting stuck while demonstrating pure Reeds-Shepp path planning.

## Key Features
- âœ… **Smart Flattening**: Robots always dig the highest point in their sector
- âœ… **No Pit Formation**: Small digs (0.03m) naturally flatten terrain without creating traps
- âœ… **Scaled Dig Size**: Dig radius = 0.6 Ã— robot width (matches footprint)
- âœ… **Pure Reeds-Shepp**: All movement uses unmodified Reeds-Shepp paths
- âœ… **Clean State Machine**: Simple digâ†’fullâ†’dumpâ†’repeat cycle
- âœ… **Improved Recovery**: 8-direction pit detection for edge cases

## Changes
- Created `SimpleDigLogic.cs` for terrain flattening algorithm
- Rewrote `VehicleBrain.cs` (removed complex scheduling/tasks)
- Made dig operations proportional to robot size
- Removed stuck detection complexity - not needed with smart digging
- Updated `SimulationDirector.cs` for new brain initialization
- Added comprehensive documentation

## Testing
- âœ… Compiles without errors or warnings
- âœ… Robots follow curved Reeds-Shepp paths
- âœ… Terrain progressively flattens
- âœ… No deep pit formation
- âœ… Dig/dump cycles complete successfully

## Merge Notes
- Merged latest main (obstacle avoidance, camera controls)
- Resolved conflicts in WorldState, VehicleAgent3D, SimulationDirector
- Obstacles present but can be moved out of view for dig demo
