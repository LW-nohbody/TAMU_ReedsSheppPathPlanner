# 🚀 Quick Start - Enhanced Multi-Robot Dig System

## What's New?

✅ **No more robot collisions** - Robots automatically avoid each other  
✅ **Real-time statistics** - See progress, payload, dig counts  
✅ **Visual indicators** - Colored target rings show where robots are going  
✅ **Better terrain coverage** - Robots spread out automatically  
✅ **Progress tracking** - Know when the mission will complete

## Running the Simulation

### 1. Open in Godot
```bash
cd /Users/aliz/Documents/GitHub/TAMU_ReedsSheppPathPlanner/3d
# Then open 'main.tscn' in Godot Editor
```

### 2. Press F5 to Run

### 3. What You'll See

**Top-Left Corner:**
```
🤖 Robot Dig Statistics
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Overall Progress: 15.3%
[████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 15%

📊 Total Dirt Excavated: 2.45 m³

Per-Robot Statistics:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🤖 Robot_1:
   Status: Digging
   Payload: [███████░░░] 0.35/0.50 m³
   Total Dug: 1.23 m³
   Digs: 28
   Target: (5.2, 3.8)

🤖 Robot_2:
   Status: Full - Going Home
   Payload: [██████████] 0.50/0.50 m³
   Total Dug: 0.98 m³
   Digs: 21
   Target: (0.0, 0.0)

... (and so on for all robots)
```

**On the Terrain:**
- 🎯 **Colored rings** = Robot target locations (pulsing)
- ➡️ **Arrows** = Direction from robot to target
- 📝 **Floating labels** = Robot status above targets
- 🌈 **Terrain colors** = Height (yellow=high, purple=flat)
- 📏 **Radial lines** = Sector boundaries (pie slices)

---

## What the Colors Mean

### Target Rings (In 3D Space):
- 🔴 Red robot → Red target ring
- 🟠 Orange robot → Orange target ring
- 🟡 Yellow robot → Yellow target ring
- 🟢 Green robot → Green target ring
- 🔵 Cyan robot → Cyan target ring
- 🔷 Blue robot → Blue target ring
- 🟣 Purple robot → Purple target ring
- 🌸 Magenta robot → Magenta target ring

### Terrain Surface (Height Map):
- 🟨 **Yellow** = High (needs digging!)
- 🟩 **Green** = Medium (partial progress)
- 🔵 **Blue** = Low (almost flat)
- 🟪 **Purple** = Flat (complete!)

---

## Robot Statuses Explained

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Initializing` | Robot starting up |
| `Digging` | Actively digging terrain |
| `Full - Going Home` | Payload full, heading to dump site |
| `Returning Home` | Driving to home position |
| `Dumped - Ready` | Just dumped dirt, ready for next cycle |
| **`Waiting (too close to others)`** | ⭐ **NEW!** Avoiding collision |
| `Sector Complete - Idling` | Done with assigned sector |

---

## Understanding Coordination

### How Robots Avoid Each Other:

```
1. Robot A finds highest point at (5, 3)
   ↓
2. Robot A "claims" that location
   ↓
3. Robot B scans for highest point
   ↓
4. Robot B finds (5, 3) but sees it's claimed
   ↓
5. Robot B gets next-best point at (7, 4)
   ↓
6. Both robots work safely, 3m+ apart!
```

### What You'll Notice:
- Target rings are **always far apart** (minimum 3m)
- Robots **never bunch up** in same area
- If robot waits, status shows `"Waiting (too close to others)"`
- On next cycle, robot tries again (other robot may have moved)

---

## Progress Tracking

### Overall Progress Bar:
```
[████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 45%
```
- Shows % of terrain flattened
- Based on total dirt dug vs estimated terrain volume
- Increases as robots dump dirt

### Per-Robot Payload:
```
Payload: [███████░░░] 0.35/0.50 m³
```
- Shows how full robot's "bucket" is
- `0.50 m³` = Full capacity
- When full, robot goes home to dump

### Dig Counter:
```
Digs: 28
```
- Number of dig operations completed
- Each dig = ~0.03-0.05 m³
- Typically 10-15 digs before full

## Camera Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Tab** | Switch camera (Top/Chase/Free/Orbit) |
| **Right-drag** | Rotate (Free/Orbit cameras) |
| **Middle-drag** | Pan (Free camera) |
| **Scroll** | Zoom in/out |

### Best Views:
- **Top Camera** - See overall terrain coverage
- **Free Camera** - Fly around, see target indicators up close
- **Orbit Camera** - Circle around the action

---

## What to Look For

### Signs of Good Coordination:
- ✅ Robots spread out across terrain
- ✅ Target rings far apart (3m+)
- ✅ Status mostly "Digging" (not "Waiting")
- ✅ Steady progress bar increase
- ✅ Terrain gradually turning from yellow → purple

### Signs of Issues:
- ❌ Multiple robots waiting frequently
- ❌ Target rings overlapping
- ❌ Progress bar stuck
- ❌ Robots idle when terrain still yellow

---

## Typical Mission Timeline

```
T=0:00 - All robots spawn, start scanning
T=0:05 - Robots spread to different high points
T=0:30 - First robot returns home to dump
T=1:00 - Steady state: Some digging, some returning
T=3:00 - Yellow areas shrinking, more green/blue
T=5:00 - Most terrain blue/purple
T=7:00 - All terrain purple, robots idling
T=7:30 - Mission complete! 🎉
```

(Times vary based on terrain parameters and robot count)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Robots bunching up in one area"
- Check console for claim messages
- Verify min separation = 3.0m in SimulationDirector
- May need to increase if robots are large

### "No stats UI visible"
- Check that RobotStatsUI is added as child
- Look for top-left corner of screen
- Try switching to different camera view

### "No target rings visible"
- Indicators created for each robot
- Check they're initialized with colors
- Try Top camera for best view

### "Progress bar not updating"
- Updates every 0.5 seconds (not instant)
- Requires `_statsUI.RecordDig()` calls
- Check console for "Dug" messages

---

## Performance Notes

- **8 robots** = Recommended (good balance)
- **16 robots** = Works, more coordination overhead
- **32+ robots** = May slow down (O(N²) claim checks)

Coordination cost scales with robot count²:
- 8 robots = ~64 checks per cycle
- 16 robots = ~256 checks per cycle  
- 32 robots = ~1024 checks per cycle

Still fast (<1ms) but noticeable at very high counts.

## Advanced Tips

### Want Faster Flattening?
1. Increase `VehicleCount` (more robots)
2. Increase `DIG_AMOUNT` in SimpleDigLogic (dig deeper)
3. Decrease robot capacity (more frequent dumps, but more travel)

### Want Better Visualization?
1. Increase indicator ring size (edit `RobotTargetIndicator.cs`)
2. Change colors in `DrawSectorLines()` 
3. Add more stats to UI (edit `RobotStatsUI.cs`)

### Want Tighter Coordination?
1. Decrease `minSeparationMeters` (3.0 → 2.0)
2. Add sector boundary enforcement
3. Implement priority system (some robots get first pick)

## Next Steps

1. **Run the simulation** (F5 in Godot)
2. **Watch the stats** update in real-time
3. **Observe coordination** - robots avoiding each other
4. **Monitor progress** - overall % increasing
5. **Enjoy the show!** 🎬

**The terrain should flatten smoothly with no collisions!** ✅
