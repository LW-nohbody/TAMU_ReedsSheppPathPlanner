# Stuck Robot Fixes - Summary

## Important: Reeds-Shepp Path Integrity
**This project demonstrates Reeds-Shepp path planning algorithms. The robots MUST follow the planned Reeds-Shepp paths exactly as computed by the algorithm. We do NOT modify or reject paths based on terrain - that would defeat the purpose of the demonstration.**

## Problem
Robots were getting stuck in terrain pits after digging operations, preventing them from continuing their dig-dump cycle.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Stuck detection too lenient**: Required 3+ arrivals within 0.5m before triggering escape
2. **Insufficient escape movement**: 1.0m backup was not enough to exit deep pits
3. **Deep pit formation**: Repeatedly digging at the same highest point created deep concentrated pits
4. **Weak local recovery**: Simple 4-direction pit detection with backing movement

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Stuck Detection (VehicleBrain.cs)
**Purpose**: Detect when robot is stuck AFTER attempting to follow Reeds-Shepp path
- **Reduced trigger threshold**: Now triggers after 2 arrivals (down from 3)
- **Added time-based detection**: Also triggers after 3 seconds stuck in same area
- **Better tracking**: Tracks both position and time since last good movement
- **Improved escape**: Extended escape sequence with 3-point path including lateral movement
- **Note**: Escape movements are NOT Reeds-Shepp paths - they're emergency recovery only

### 2. Improved Local Recovery (VehicleAgent3D.cs)
**Purpose**: Help robot climb out of pits when given empty path (recovery mode)
- **8-direction pit detection**: Samples terrain in all 8 cardinal/diagonal directions
- **Intelligent escape direction**: Climbs toward the highest neighboring point
- **Larger escape distance**: Moves 1.6m toward exit (vs 0.6m backup previously)
- **Better threshold**: Triggers at 0.15m depth difference (vs 0.18m)
- **Forward movement**: Uses forward gear to climb out instead of backing
- **Note**: Only activates when controller receives empty path, not during normal operation

### 3. What We Did NOT Change
- **Reeds-Shepp path planning**: Algorithm unchanged, paths followed exactly as planned
- **Path validation**: We do NOT reject or modify Reeds-Shepp paths based on terrain
- **Goal selection**: Scheduler and planner logic unchanged
- **Movement physics**: Robot still follows the planned path points precisely

## Parameters Tuned
```csharp
// VehicleBrain.cs - ONLY for stuck recovery, not path planning
MAX_STUCK_COUNT = 2           // Was: 3
MAX_STUCK_TIME = 3.0f         // New parameter
Escape distance = 1.5m + 1.0m // Was: 1.0m (emergency recovery only)

// VehicleAgent3D.cs - ONLY for local pit recovery
Pit detection threshold = 0.15m  // Was: 0.18m
Escape distance = 1.6m           // Was: 0.6m
```

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Monitor stuck recovery logs**: Watch for "[StuckRecovery]" and "[LocalRecovery]" messages
2. **Verify Reeds-Shepp paths**: Ensure robots follow the planned curved paths (not straight lines)
3. **Observe robot behavior**: 
   - Do robots follow characteristic Reeds-Shepp curves (C|C|C, CSC, etc.)?
   - Do they escape pits within 5-10 seconds via recovery mode?
   - Are dig/dump cycles completing successfully?
4. **Adjust recovery if needed**:
   - Increase MAX_STUCK_TIME if recovery triggers too often during normal operation
   - Adjust pit detection threshold if robots miss pit detection
   - Tune escape distances if robots can't get out of deep pits

## Known Limitations
- Recovery movements (escape/pit climbing) are NOT Reeds-Shepp paths - they're simple emergency maneuvers
- Very deep pits (>1m) may still trap robots permanently
- Recovery depends on terrain being navigable in at least one direction
- Does not account for dynamic obstacles or other robots
- Repeated digging at same location will eventually create deep pits

## Future Improvements
- Add terrain flattening or "fill" at dig sites after several operations
- Implement dig-site rotation to spread digging across the sector
- Add visual warnings when pits become too deep
- Create global recovery system for permanently stuck robots
- Consider raising terrain at dump sites to visualize dirt piles
- Add statistics tracking for Reeds-Shepp path types used (CSC, CCC, etc.)
